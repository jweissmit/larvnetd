.SH NAME
larvnetd \- Monitor cluster workstations and printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B larvnetd [-n] [-f \fIconfigfile\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B larvnetd
monitors a set of cluster machines and printers given by the file
.B /etc/athena/larvnet.conf
(see
.BR larvnet.conf (5))
or a file specified on the command line with the \-f option.
Normally, it backgrounds itself and dissociates itself from the
controlling tty after binding to the larvnet port, but this behavior
can be suppressed with the \-n command-line option.
.PP
.B larvnetd
processes status notifications received from cluster workstations on
the larvnet port.  It will periodically poll those workstations it has
not heard from recently, using the busypoll service (see
.BR busyd (8)).
Once a minute,
.B larvnetd
requests a queue status for each of the printers it is configured to
monitor.  Also once a minute,
.B larvnetd
generates three report files:
.RS
.B /var/athena/larvnet.cgroups
.br
.B /var/athena/larvnet.clusters
.br
.B /var/athena/larvnet.printers
.RE
which give the current known status of cluster workstations and
printers.
.PP
.B larvnetd
will reread its configuration file upon receiving a SIGHUP.
.PP
.B larvnetd
syslogs errors and debugging messages using the local5 facility name.
.SH NOTES
Larvnet is monitoring you.
